### Nudging towards "climatology"

The nudging towards "climatology" is an optional step to avoid issue (like sharp gradients) near the open sea boundaries.
A flow relexation zone can be implemented in ROMS by using the followings settings:

```
LtracerCLM == T T  ! enable processing of CLIM data
LnudgeTCLM == T T  ! nudge to CLIM data
TNUDG == 2*10.0d0                    ! days
```

Make nudging on inflow is stronger than on outflow

```
OBCFAC == 10.0d0                      ! nondimensional
```

Set also `NUDNAME` to the file name create by the julia script.


### Atmospheric forcing fields

* For the Ligurian Sea, necessary parameters have already been prepared and are available in the file [ROMS-implementation.zip](https://dox.ulg.ac.be/index.php/s/nH8u2DrI1m9mMbC). It containts data download the from
the ECMWF operational archive (`Atmosphere/ecmwf_operational_archive_2018-12-01T00:00:00_2020-01-01T00:00:00.nc`). This NetCDF file needs to be converted by the julia function `ROMS.prepare_ecmwf`.

* The remaining of this section explained how to download data from the ECMWF operational archive (e.g. for a different domain). These instructions are not needed now.
* Adapt the file name, longitude/latitude and time range (start one day earlier, and finish one day later) in [`forcing_ecmwf.py`](https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/ROMS.jl/blob/master/examples/forcing_ecmwf.py) and execute the script as follows:

```bash
python3 forcing_ecmwf.py
```

### Validation

Check out satellite data (e.g. sea surface temperature, sea surface height) at:
* [CMEMS](https://marine.copernicus.eu/)
* [PODAAC NASA](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/)

Make some comparison with satellite and the downloaded in situ observation
