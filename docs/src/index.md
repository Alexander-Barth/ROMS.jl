# ROMS

This package allows to setup necessary files for the [ROMS ocean model](https://www.myroms.org/).

## Tutorial

This tutorial is for students following the ULi√®ge lecture OCEA0036-1 but might be useful for others as well.

### Using for the first time a UNIX/Linux-like environment?

* Please pay attention to the difference between upper- and lowercase letters
* Presence and absence of white space is also significant
* Check out the [basic shell commands](https://diyhacking.com/linux-commands-for-beginners/) and [this tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)
* Avoid using directories and file names with a space in them, otherwise you need to put the directory in quotes (single or double quotes) or use black-slash (\\) in front of the white space. For example, shell command `cd My Directory Name` does not work, use one of the following instead:

```bash
cd "My Directory Name"
cd 'My Directory Name'
cd My\ Directory\ Name
```

### Registration

Please register at:
* [ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System)](https://www.myroms.org/index.php?page=RomsCode).
* [CMEMS (Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service)](http://marine.copernicus.eu/services-portfolio/register-now/)

To generate new forcing fields, register at (optional):
* [ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts)](https://apps.ecmwf.int/registration/)


### Required software

A preconfigured virtual machine is available [here](http://data-assimilation.net/upload/OCEA0036/Ubuntu-20.04-MATE-Julia-ROMS.ova). The account `student` has the password `tritro`. In this virtual machine, all software is already pre-installed. The OVA file must be [imported in Virtual Box](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26217_01/E26796/html/qs-import-vm.html).
If you do not use this virtual machine the following software need to be installed:

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Under Linux, you can install Julia with the following shell commands:

```bash
cd /opt/
sudo wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.6/julia-1.6.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvf julia-1.6.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo rm julia-1.6.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo ln -s /opt/julia-1.6.3/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia
```

More information is available [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).

Under Linux, you need to install also `python3-matplotlib` for PyPlot. On Debian/Ubuntu, this packages can be installed by this command:


```bash
sudo apt install python3-matplotlib
```

* Julia package, `PyPlot`, `NCDatasets`, `ROMS` which can be installed by:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PyPlot")
Pkg.add("NCDatasets")
Pkg.develop(url="https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/ROMS.jl")
```

* ROMS source. This example uses the version 3.9 of ROMS. We assume that the ROMS source is copied in `~/src/roms`:

```bash
mkdir ~/src/
cd ~/src/
svn checkout --non-interactive  --username "$ROMS_USERNAME" \
    --password "$ROMS_PASSWORD" https://www.myroms.org/svn/src/tags/roms-3.9 roms
```

In the previous command, you need to replace `$ROMS_USERNAME` and `$ROMS_PASSWORD` by your username and password.


Other required software typically available from a package manager:
* A Fortran 90 compiler (e.g. gfortran)
* GNU make
* NetCDF (including headers files for development and the tools `ncdump`, `nf-config`)
* perl
* Python and pip
* MPI (optional)
* subversion (optional)
* git (optional)

Note that all libraries (NetCDF and MPI) must be compiled with the same Fortran compiler.

On Windows, various ways exist to install gfortran, GNU make and other dependencies:
* Windows Subsystem for Linux
     * [Installation guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide)
     * [FAQ (in particular exchanging files)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq)
* [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
* [MINGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* Linux virtual machine using e.g. VirtualBox
* ...

On MacOS X:
* Homebrew https://brew.sh/
* ...

On Debian/Ubuntu, these packages can be installed by this command:

```bash
sudo apt install gfortran make perl netcdf-bin libnetcdff-dev libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin subversion git python3-pip python3-setuptools unzip
```

* For CMEMS data, you need the python package `motuclient` ([installation instructions](https://github.com/clstoulouse/motu-client-python#Installation)).
For example:

```bash
# to install a specific version use
python3 -m pip install --user motuclient==1.8.6
# or to install the latest version use:
# python3 -m pip install --user motuclient
```

I advice you to use version 1.8.6 of motuclient because of [this issue](https://github.com/clstoulouse/motu-client-python/issues/27).
Normally you will see the warning `WARNING: The script motuclient is installed in '.../.local/bin' which is not on PATH. Consider adding this directory to PATH`.
You need to add the following line to the file `.bashrc` located in your home directory (at the end of this file on a separate line):

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

In a terminal execute the following so that this change takes effect:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```


* For ECMWF data, you need the pacakge `ecmwf-api-client-python` (optional). Follow the [installation instructions](https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/WEBAPI/Access+ECMWF+Public+Datasets) (including the ECMWF key). For questions related to ECMWF data access please also consult [this document](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/access-forecasts/ecmwf-web-api).
* Note that the ECMWF key is different from your ECMWF password.

### Check your environment

* Check julia version:

```bash
julia --version
```

* Check the Fortran Compiler

```bash
gfortran --version
```

* MPI
```bash
mpif90 --version
mpirun --help
```

* NetCDF
```bash
nf-config --all
```
*or* the old name `nc-config`:

```bash
nc-config --all
```

If you have `nc-config` (with Fortran support) but not `nf-config`, you can run the following:

``` bash
ln -s /usr/bin/nc-config $HOME/bin/nf-config
```
Or set later the environemt variable `NF_CONFIG` to `nc-config`.

* Check the `motuclient` (it may return `vUnknown`, but it should not return `No module named motuclient`)

```bash
motuclient --version
```

These commands should return a basic usage info or the version number if they are correctly installed.

### Data

* The full [GEBCO bathymetry](http://modb.oce.ulg.ac.be/mediawiki/upload/OCEA0036/gebco_30sec_1.nc) (the file `gebco_30sec_1.nc` is already included in the virtual machine)


### Area

Choose an area:

* What interesting processes are present in your studied area? (note: now we all use the Ligurian Sea)
* Are there in situ measurements available for your area? Look for temperature and salinity within your areas (for any time frame)
     * Check with [World Ocean Database](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/SELECT/dbsearch/dbsearch.html)
     * [CMEMS in situ Thematic Assemble Centre (TAC)](http://marine.copernicus.eu/)
* Visualize a couple of downloaded profiles:
     * Hints: in Julia you can use the package [`NCDatasets`](https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/NCDatasets.jl)
     * How would you distribute the vertical resolution in your model represent this profile?

* Check that your longitude/latitude/time range model of your nested model is within longitude/latitude/time range of the outer model providing the boundary conditions

* Choose the domain such to avoid unnecessary open ocean boundary conditions

### Atmospheric forcing fields


* For the Ligurian Sea, necessary parameters have already been prepared and are available in the file [ROMS-implementation.zip](https://dox.ulg.ac.be/index.php/s/nH8u2DrI1m9mMbC). It containts data download the from
the ECMWF operational archive (`Atmosphere/ecmwf_operational_archive_2018-12-01T00:00:00_2020-01-01T00:00:00.nc`). This NetCDF file needs to be converted by the julia function `ROMS.prepare_ecmwf`.

* The remaining of this section explained how to download data from the ECMWF operational archive (e.g. for a different domain). These instructions are not needed now.
* Adapt the file name, longitude/latitude and time range (start one day earlier, and finish one day later) in [`forcing_ecmwf.py`](https://github.com/Alexander-Barth/ROMS.jl/blob/master/examples/forcing_ecmwf.py) and execute the script as follows:

```bash
python3 forcing_ecmwf.py
```

List of variables (*: quantities accumulated over the integration period ("step"))

| NetCDF Variable name | Description |
|----------------------|----------|
| msl | Mean sea level pressure |
| u10 | 10 metre U wind component |
| v10 | 10 metre V wind component |
| t2m | 2 metre temperature |
| d2m | 2 metre dewpoint temperature |
| tcc | Total cloud cover* |
| sshf | Surface sensible heat flux* |
| strd | Surface thermal radiation downwards* |
| ssr | Surface net solar radiation* |
| str | Surface net thermal radiation* |
| ewss | Eastward turbulent surface stress* |
| nsss | Northward turbulent surface stress* |
| e | Evaporation* |
| ro | Runoff* |
| tp | Total precipitation* |
| sst | Sea surface temperature |
| par | Photosynthetically active radiation at the surface* |

### Generate initial, boundary conditions and forcing files

* Adapt the [`example_config.jl`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexander-Barth/ROMS.jl/master/test/example_config.jl) file and call it `yourdomain_config.jl` where you replace `yourdomain` by the the name of your domain (lowercase and without space). For the Ligurian Sea, use `liguriansea_config.jl`.

    * Longitude/latitude bounding box
    * File paths
    * Time range
    * ...

* For CMEMS boundary conditions:
    * You may need to adapt `service_id`, `motu_server` and `mapping` (if model is outside the Mediterranean Sea)
    * Data will be downloaded and saved in NetCDF by "chunks" of 60 days in the folder `OGCM` under the content of the variable `basedir`
    * You need to remove the files in this directory if you rerun the script with a different time range.

* Run in Julia
```julia
include("yourdomain_config.jl")
```

* Check the resulting files: initial conditions, boundary conditions, interpolated model (`clim` file) and visualize the these files along some sections.

### ROMS compilation

* Create a directory (avoid directory names with spaces) for your model configuration
* Compile ROMS:
    * configure ROMS by creating a file `yourdomain.h` (e.g. `liguriansea.h` for the Ligurian Sea):

```C
#define UV_ADV                    /* turn ON advection terms */
#define UV_COR                    /* turn ON Coriolis term */

#define ANA_BSFLUX                /* analytical bottom salinity flux */
#define ANA_BTFLUX                /* analytical bottom temperature flux */
#define ANA_SSFLUX

#define BULK_FLUXES               /* turn ON bulk fluxes computation */
#define CLOUDS
#define LONGWAVE
#define SOLAR_SOURCE
```

* Copy the script `build_roms.sh` to the directory `~/ROMS-implementation-test`

```bash
cd ~/ROMS-implementation-test
cp ~/src/roms/ROMS/Bin/build_roms.sh build_roms.sh
```

* Copy it to this directory and adapt it. Here is a list of changes that I made highlighted with the [diff tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_utility#Unified_format).

```

If you do not have the tool `nf-config`, you need to add this line `export NF_CONFIG=nc-config`.


* Review your changes with:

```bash
diff ~/src/roms/ROMS/Bin/build_roms.sh build_roms.sh
```

*  compile ROMS by running:

```bash
./build_roms.sh -j 2
```

where you need to replace `/path/to/previous` by the appropriate file path.

 * copy `varinfo.dat` from `~/src/roms/ROMS/External/varinfo.dat` in your current directory:

```bash
cp ~/src/roms/ROMS/External/varinfo.dat .
```


### ROMS model domain configuration

 * copy `roms.in` from `~/src/roms/User/External/roms.in` in the directory `~/ROMS-implementation-test`:

```bash
cp  ~/src/roms/User/External/roms.in .
```

 * check the glossary at the end of this file for the meaning of the keys that we will change
 * when editing this file, do not use "tabs".

 * adapt `MyAppCPP` and change it to `LIGURIANSEA`

 * adapt file names `VARNAME`, `GRDNAME`, `ININAME`, `BRYNAME`, `CLMNAME`, `FRCNAME` and `NFFILES`

 * also make sure that these variables are set (number of files with boundary conditions and climatology). If they do not exist, they need to be added (near `BRYNAME` for example).

```
 NBCFILES == 1
NCLMFILES == 1
```

 * change `Lm`, `Mm` and `N` based on the dimensions of your grid (make sure to read the glossary for these variable in `roms.in`)

 * adapt boundaries `LBC`
 * set the starting time and time reference
```
DSTART = ...
TIME_REF =  18581117
```

where `DSTART` is here the number of days since 1858-11-17 or November 17, 1858 (see also [modified Julia day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day#Variants)). For instance the number of days since 2014-01-01 (year-month-day) can be computed by of following commands in Julia:

```julia
using Dates
Date(2020,1,1) - Date(1858,11,17)
```

The inverse operation can be done with:

```julia
using Dates
Date(1858,11,17) + Day(58849)
```

You can use `DateTime` if you want to specify hour, minutes or seconds.

* Adapt the length of a time step `DT` (in seconds) and number of time steps `NTIMES`
* Initially we choose:
    * `NTIMES` -> number of time step corresponding to 1 day (e.g. `24*60*60/DT` as `DT` is in seconds)
    * `NHIS`, `NAVG`-> number of time steps corresponding to 1 hour
    * `NRST` -> number of time steps correspond to 1 hour


### Nudging towards "climatology"

A flow relexation zone can be implemented in ROMS by using the followings settings:

```
LtracerCLM == T T  ! enable processing of CLIM data
LnudgeTCLM == T T  ! nudge to CLIM data
TNUDG == 2*10.0d0                    ! days
```

Make nudging on inflow is stronger than on outflow

```
OBCFAC == 10.0d0                      ! nondimensional
```

Set also `NUDNAME` to the file name create by the julia script.

### Run ROMS

#### Run ROMS without MPI

* To run ROMS without MPI, one need to disable MPI in `build_roms.sh`. The ROMS binary will be called `romsS` and call be called by:

```bash
./romsS < roms.in | tee roms.out
```

#### Run ROMS with MPI

* How many CPU cores does your machine have? You can use the command `top` in a shell terminal followed by `1`.
* In `build_roms.sh` set `USE_MPI=on` (which is actually the default value)
 * Recompile ROMS
 * Change in `roms.in` the parameters `NtileI` and `NtileJ`. The number of CPU cores should be `NtileI` * `NtileJ`.
 * Run ROMS with, e.g.

```bash
mpirun -np 4 ./romsM  roms.in | tee roms.out
```
where 4 is the number of cores to use.


With the command `tee` the normal screen output will be place in the file `roms.out` but still be printed on the screen.

* A problem? What does the error message say?
* Outputs are in `roms_his.nc` and `roms_avg.nc`, plot some variables like sea surface height and sea surface temperature at the beginning and the end of the simulation.

* In Julia, force figure 1 and to 2 to have the same color-bar.

```julia
figure(); p1 = pcolor(randn(3,3)); colorbar()
figure(); p2 = pcolor(randn(3,3)); colorbar()
p2.set_clim(p1.get_clim())
```

* If everything runs fine,
    * is the model still stable with a longer time steps (`DT`) ?
    * increase the number of time steps (`NTIMES`)
    * possibly adapt the frequency at which you save the model results (`NHIS`, `NAVG`,`NRST`)

### Interpreting ROMS output

* Check minimum and maximum value of the different parameters
```
 NLM: GET_STATE - Read state initial conditions,             t = 57235 00:00:00
                   (Grid 02, File: roms_nest_his.nc, Rec=0182, Index=1)
                - free-surface
                   (Min = -4.63564634E-01 Max = -3.63838434E-01)
```

* The barotropic, baroclinic and Coriolis Courant number should be smaller than 1

```
 Minimum barotropic Courant Number =  2.09670689E-02
 Maximum barotropic Courant Number =  5.56799674E-01
 Maximum Coriolis   Courant Number =  1.71574766E-03
```

* Information
    * energy (kinetic, potential, total) and volume
    * maximum Courant number

### Validation

Check out satellite data (e.g. sea surface temperature, sea surface height) at:
* [CMEMS](http://marine.copernicus.eu/)
* [PODAAC NASA](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/)

Make some comparison with satellite and the downloaded in situ observation
